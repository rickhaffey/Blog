My name is Rick Haffey.

I'm a software developer working as a consultant with <a href="http://www.claritycon.com">Clarity Consulting</a>. Since starting at Clarity, I've worked with clients in the retail, insurance, finance, and legal verticals. From a technology standpoint, almost all of my projects have centered around C# and ASP.net.

I'm also currently in the process of working towards my Master's degree in Computer Science from DePaul University's <a href="http://www.cdm.depaul.edu">College of Computing and Digital Media</a>. Shortly after starting my studies at DePaul, I took a course in digital image processing, and was hooked. Going forward, my plan is to focus my studies and research in the areas of computer vision and machine learning.

On a personal note, I live and play in the northwest suburbs of Chicago with my wife, Sarah, and two sons, Ian and Alex.
