Today, I'd like to spend some time reviewing a map that I'll be using along my journey.  I'll then move down from the 10,000 foot perspective, to look at the first leg of my journey in a little more detail.  Lastly, I'll talk a bit about my next steps -- getting both of my primary vehicles (Matlab and OpenCV) set up for travel.
