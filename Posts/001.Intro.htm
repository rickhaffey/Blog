<p>I'm setting off on a journey today.  I'm heading out into the world of image processing, pattern recognition, machine learning, and ultimately, computer vision.  As with any journey, so that I don't end up just rambling aimlessly, I want to have a clear picture of where I'm headed. After some consideration, I have a rough idea of what <a href="http://pascallin.ecs.soton.ac.uk/challenges/VOC/index.html">my final destination</a> will be -- the path and goal will get clearer once I start moving.  

(One thing to keep in mind, though, is that a destination often ends up being just another starting point to a new journey...)
</p>
<p>With a journey of any length, it's wise to break things out into stages.  This journey is no different. Each leg of the journey will have an intermediate destination, based on the goal of solving a specific problem.  Throughout the trip, the landscape will change based on where I'm at and where I'm headed at that point in time.  Sometimes, it will look a lot like a tutorial or code walkthrough.  Other times, it may feel more like a deep dive into the theory behind a problem or technique.  Often, I'll find that I need to backtrack in order to revisit fundamentals that I need in order to make forward progress.  Sometimes, I may even decide to take a temporary detour in order to visit something interesting or unexpected in the landscape, always with the intent of coming back to the main path in due time.</p>
<p>On any journey, one of the most important factors in successfully arriving at the destination is the vehicle used in getting from one place to another.  I expect that I'll need many vehicles along this path, but I know of two that will come into play in almost every stage of the journey:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/">Matlab</a>, one of the most (if not <em>the</em> most) popular tools for <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/image/">investigating and prototyping image processing techniques</a>, and
</li>
<li><a href="http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/">OpenCV</a>, an open source computer vision library with APIs in C++, C, and Python.
 </li>
</ul>

<p>Although I expect that I'll eventually arrive in uncharted territories, I know that the early parts of my journey will cover paths that have been well travelled by others before me.  Like any reasonable traveller, I've decided to follow the guidance of these other travelers while planning and traveling my own path.  Some of the guides I've chosen include:  
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.imageprocessingplace.com/DIP-3E/dip3e_main_page.htm">Digital Image Processing</a>, 3rd Edition, Gonzalez &amp; Woods, 2008.</li>

<li><a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596516130">Learning OpenCV</a>, Bradski &amp; Kaehler, 2008.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>I know the trip won't be easy, and I'm sure it will present its share of challenges along the way.  But what journey that was worth undertaking was without challenges?  This one is definitely worth the effort.</p>

<p>Care to join me?</p>
